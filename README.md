***A nice and simple, [slash command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#slash-commands)-based, [Discord](https://discord.com/) utility bot.***

</center>

## Features

 - Intuitive, [slash command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#slash-commands)-based interface
 - Open source and written in [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) and [discord-py-slash-command](https://discord-py-slash-command.readthedocs.io)
 - All commands do not require a database (for now)
 - Zero configuration needed

### Available commands
#### `/ping`

> Returns the bot's [ping](https://www.rtr.at/TKP/service/rtr-nettest/help/test_result/netztestfaq_testergebnis_0300.en.html) in miliseconds

Other than being a basic sanity check, this command is quite useless.

#### `/igotpinged`

> Get the last message(s) pinging you after your last message sent in the channel

When you're in servers where people talk 100 messages a minute, this command is useful when

1. You got pinged when you come back
2. You don't want to scroll through all those messages to find who pinged you and why

While Discord's find feature is nice, typing `/igotpinged` saves a lot of keystrokes or (in the case of mobile) tapping.

#### `/emoji_backup`

> Back up the guild's emojis

Get a copy of the current guild (server)'s emojis. This is useful for backing up emojis for a guild that freely allows emoji modification (e.g. [my server](https://thatxliner.github.io/discord/server.html)).

#### ~~`/cc @someone, ...`~~ (currently disabled)

> Sends a dm to the people you `/cc`'d with your last message's contents and jump-link. Also tells them who else you CC'd

Because just pinging them is risky.

1. Your original message (or the message you used to ping them) can get deleted
2. And if number 1 happens, your reputation will be ruined because you "ghost pinged them"

DMs are a safe and persistent place for dumping messages.

**NOTE:** Because of Discord's current API limits, you can only [`/cc`](#cc-someone-)/[`/bcc`](#bcc-someone-) a limited number of people. I have currently made that limit *10* but **if you want to make the limit higher, request it in our [issue tracker][issue]**

#### ~~`/bcc @someone, ...`~~ (currently disabled)

> Sends a dm to the people you `/bcc`'d with your last message's contents and jump-link

Basically [`/cc`](#cc-someone-) but the dm message doesn't tell them who else you've CC'd.

#### `/poll question, choice1, choice2, ...`

> Send a multi-choice poll (options mutually exclusive)

This is useful if you want a group vote. This command will also add the necessary reactions.

This differs from Dyno's `poll` command in that it enforces the mutually exclusive reactions

**NOTE:** The current limit of choices is 10

#### `/yesno question`

> Send a yes-or-no question (options mutually exclusive)

Because yes. Or was it no? It's like [`/poll`](#poll-question-choice1-choice2) because it *also* has mutually exclusive options. But, instead of allowing the choices to be configurable, there are only 2: :+1: and :-1:.

#### `/invite`

> Our bot's invite links!

Because yes!

#### `/vote`

> Vote for our bot here!

Please.

#### `/???`

> ???
